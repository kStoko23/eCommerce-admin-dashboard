This is my portfolio project, which aims to mock real E-commerce shop data and provide a user-friendly web app to serve it. Built using Python with Django, PostgreSQL, React and Tailwind.css. It is my first time building a project with Django and React, both in tandem and stand-alone.

## Intro

I wanted to try my skills in fullstack development for some time now. Before I mainly did frontend on few internships and in my spare time/as an assignment i played with diffrent languages, such as [Python](https://github.com/kStoko23/fractal-generation), [PHP & Javascript](https://github.com/kStoko23/project-manager) and some [Java](https://github.com/kStoko23/Sudoku-android-studio) in Andriod Studio. I always anjoyed fiddling with more or less complex algorithms on the backend side, but developing frontend solutions came naturally to me, so I mainly did that. Now tho I want to broaden my skill set and become a fullstack developer, hence this project. Both a show piece and a learning experiance for me.

## Project structure

I decided to keep both frontend and backend in one repo, since it's not going to be a fully implemented product, so scalability is not a big concern of mine.

## Techstack

I decided to use Python with Django for my backend, without any particular reason beside wanting to learn and try it.

For the database I chose PostgreSQL, since I feel pretty good with relational databases and it's open source.

On the frontend I opted for React - again I want to learn new stuff, it being very popular is another plus.

Went with Typescript, since I mainly used strongly typed languages and feel better using them.

I grew good knowledge of Tailwind while I was on internship and really liked it, so it was basically 'why not?' for me.

Will probably docerize whole thing - another learning step in this project.

As you can see I mostly chose technologies in which I have little to no experience, becuase again - I want to learn it and gain some usefull skills on the way. Hope it's gonna pay off.

## Dataset

Data used to mock real life transactions and orders of an e-commerce shop is synthetically generated using a Python script: [data_gen.py](ecommerce_mock_project/backend/misc/data_gen.py). Inspiration was taken from this dataset found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting). I could've used this ready-to-go dataset, but IMO it was lacking in terms of contents and I wanted to have some fun with generating the data myself (also I really enjoyed it while writing my thesis, [link](https://github.com/kStoko23/Praca-licencjacka) for those interested in that, it's in Polish tho).
